	<p><strong>Distributed Services for International Clients &ndash; 2018</strong></p>
<p>In the Summer of 2018, I created an online arbitrage business. The initial task was to truly understand the, often unspoken, needs of primarily US clients. I then translated the clarified projects into distinct work tasks for skilled specialists in both Western and low-cost countries, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, UK, US and others. I identified and pitched for projects, sought out appropriate skilled specialists and negotiated rates.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Specific projects included:</p>
<p>&bull; VFX work for a short film</p>
<p>&bull; Editing several videos, shown to 15,000 people</p>
<p>&bull; Creating a comic book for an escape room</p>
<p>&bull; CAD drawings for architects</p>
<p>Excellent communication and effective project management and delegation were critical to the success of these projects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Reseller of Jewellery to Global Customers &ndash; 2018</strong></p>
<p>During 2018 I established an online store, selling a range of jewellery. I created a website, sourced products from China and worked with several Instagram influencers to market the items. Customers were from all corners of the globe.</p>
<p>I completed market research and established the niche that I wanted to target. I tailored terms and conditions of sales, considering factors such as GDPR. I managed customer services enquiries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Published Article on Home Automation to Global Magazine &ndash; 2018</strong></p>
<p>During early 2018 I both pitched and subsequently wrote an article about DIY home automation. The article focused on the easily accessible home automation software run through a Raspberry Pi, Home Assistant. This article was published in May 2018 and was sold in several markets globally.</p>

<p><strong>Developed Multiple Apps for Apple App Store &ndash; 2017</strong></p>
<p>I programmed and published two apps for the Apple App Store. The first was an app for the Apple Watch with the aim to increase concentration through brain exercises. The second app was bingo for the Apple Watch. In total, I have had more than 2,100 organic downloads of the apps since launch, without any promotion.</p>
