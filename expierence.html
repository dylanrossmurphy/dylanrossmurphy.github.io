<p><strong>Distributed services for international clients</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years, I created an online service business. The initial task was to truly understand the, often unspoken, needs of primarily US clients. Once, the needs had been understood the main objective was to up sell them to other services. As an example a customer who wanted a $100 business card ended up spending $1,200 on a website. The work was then outsourced to foreign workers resulting in up to 95% net profit margins. Thousands of pounds of net profit are a testimony for how I can convince customers to purchase.&nbsp;Excellent sales strategies were critical to the success of these projects.</p>
<p>Specific projects included:</p>
<p>- VFX work for a short film</p>
<p>- Editing several videos, shown to 15,000 people</p>
<p>- Creating a comic book for an escape room</p>
<p>- CAD drawings for architects</p>
<p>- Website for an interior design company</p>
<p><strong>The Ocean&rsquo;s Jewel</strong></p>
<p>During 2018 I personally established an online store, selling a range of jewellery. Every detail from the ideal website copy to the highest converting font were all contributors to this being a high converting store. This enabled me to learn a lot of what makes a customer want to purchase and what keeps them coming back.</p>
<p><strong>Tesco</strong></p>
<p>To broaden my people skills I got a job at Tesco. My experience at Tesco allowed to me learn how to best interact with the public to give them a good experience which will keep them coming back. I learnt a lot about up selling the customer to more expensive products.</p>
<p><strong>Koi</strong></p>
<p>Working in a Koi business required different sales skills to be employed. Cost of fish go into the tens of thousands which require a different approach of selling to be used. I learnt a lot about how to approach a purchase of high value. Furthermore, the experience I gained in negotiating have proved crucial in other jobs, such as the distribution of online services.</p>
